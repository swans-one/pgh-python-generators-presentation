    "Python introduced coroutines as \"Enhanced Generators\" in PEP 342 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0342/), by introducing the \"yield expression\". That is by making it possible to have `yield` on the right hand side of assignment."

    "When using a yield expression, the coroutine receives a value through a call to its `send` method. Like `next`, sending a value progresses to the next `yield` and suspends execution. In fact, given an instance of a generator, say `my_gen`, calling `next(my_gen)` is the same as `my_gen.send(None)`.\n",
